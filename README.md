# krunner-symbols

A little krunner plugin to retrieve unicode symbols (or any other string) based on a corresponding keyword.

![Demonstration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domschrei/krunner-symbols/master/demonstration1.png)

E.g. you can type `lambda` and krunner will yield the proper unicode symbol Î». It can be used to quickly get a symbol when writing some text, or to retrieve often-needed texts (or links, or emotes ...) by typing a certain abbreviation.

Which keywords and symbols are supported depends on an open-ended text file (see *Configuration*).

If you are interested in the project, have any recommendations or suggestions, feel free to contact me or post an issue. As I did not have any experience with Plasma development before, I am happy to hear about how I can improve the code.

## Installation

You can execute the following commands (which are also described in the `INSTALL` file) in order to install the plugin. However, please note that this is in an early stage of development, which is why you have to copy the config file yourself (see 3rd last line).
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kf5-config --prefix` -DQT_PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR=`kf5-config --qt-plugins`
make 
sudo make install
cp ../krunner-symbols ~/.config/krunner-symbols
kquitapp krunner
krunner
```

## Configuration

Instead of editing the primary source `~/.config/krunner-symbols`, you can create a second file `~/.config/krunner-symbols-custom` where you can change and/or extend the recognized symbols without changing the original ones. That way, if you update or reinstall this plugin, you won't lose your custom definitions. Keep in mind that you will have to restart krunner (`kquitapp krunner && krunner`) for configuration changes to take effect.

The syntax is easy. Just create lines like this:
```
Keyword=Output
```
, where `Keyword` is what you have to type and `Output` is what you get when typing it. They can be entire sentences, or just single symbols. To insert a comment, you can do this: 

```
# Lalala the program can't hear me
```

Blank lines are okay, too.

TL;DR: Just look at the file `krunner-symbols` and you will get the idea.

## Usage

Open krunner and enter the keyword for the symbol you want to copy. Click on the appearing entry tagged with *Symbols* or press Enter while focusing it. krunner disappears and the result has been copied to your clipboard. With `Ctrl+V`, you can paste it anywhere.

You can also use the plugin as some more general form of alias-resolver (i.e. entering some keyword in order to get the corresponding text) by editing the configuration file appropriately.
