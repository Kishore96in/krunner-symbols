# krunner-symbols

A little krunner plugin (Plasma 5) to retrieve unicode symbols, or any other string, based on a corresponding keyword.

![Demonstration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domschrei/krunner-symbols/master/img/demonstration1.png)

E.g. you can type `lambda` and krunner will yield the proper unicode symbol Î». It can be used to quickly get a symbol when writing some text, or to retrieve often-needed texts (or links, or emotes ...) by typing a certain abbreviation.

Which keywords and symbols are supported depends on an open-ended text file (see *Configuration*).

## Why?

krunner is a great tool because it's always accessible, very fast, and really unintrusive, as it temporarily gets focused when called, but then returns the focus to the previously focused view when finished. Because of this, a quick krunner query can be perfectly integrated into a user's workflow, adding efficiency and convenience. This little tool is meant to support this idea of usage.

If you are interested in the project, have any recommendations or suggestions, feel free to contact me or post an issue. As I did not have any experience with Plasma development before, I am happy to hear about how I can improve the code and/or the build process.

## Installation

You can execute the install script (inside the `krunner-symbols` directory, execute the command `bash install.sh`) in order to install the plugin. Arch Linux users can install the `plasma5-runners-symbols` [package from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plasma5-runners-symbols/ "link to AUR package"), which is based on the most recent release here on Github.

## Configuration

**TL;DR:** Look at the file `krunner-symbolsrc` and you will get the idea. Store custom stuff in `~/.config/krunner-symbolsrc`.

Additional to the primary source `/usr/share/config/krunner-symbolsrc`, you can create a second file `~/.config/krunner-symbolsrc` where you can create custom, additional definitions. Keep in mind that you will have to restart krunner (`kquitapp krunner && krunner`) for configuration changes to take effect.

The syntax is easy. In the first line, the config group "Definitions" has to be defined:
```
[Definitions]
```
For custom definitions, just create lines like this:
```
Keyword=Output
```
, where `Keyword` is what you have to type and `Output` is what you get when typing it. They can be entire sentences, or just single symbols. To insert a comment, you can do this: 

```
# Lalala the program can't hear me
```

Blank lines are okay, too.

### Advanced

If you feel like doing just about *everything* with `krunner`, you can even add definitions like this:

```
# Open the KDE homepage in the standard browser
kde=open:https://www.kde.org/

# Open this plugin's configuration in the standard text editor
config=open:~/.config/krunner-symbolsrc

# Open the folder Documents in the standard file browser
doc=open:~/Documents

# Execute the given command
rmb=exec:cd workspace && rm -f build/
```

If selected, these types of definitions (beginning with `open:` or `exec:`) will not copy the result to the clipboard, but actually try to open / execute the specified location or command, using the corresponding standard application.

## Usage

Open krunner and enter the keyword for the symbol you want to copy. Click on the appearing entry tagged with *Symbols* or press Enter while focusing it. krunner disappears and the result has been copied to your clipboard. With `Ctrl+V`, you can paste it anywhere.

You can also use the plugin as some more general form of alias-resolver (i.e. entering some keyword in order to get the corresponding text) by editing the configuration file appropriately.
